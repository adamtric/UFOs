# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to refactor and improve the user friendliness of the html file that is designed to help individuals easily scalp data of UFO sightings. By adding additional search criteria in a filter search area, we are able to help individuals find the data they are searching for on this subject. In this project, we are adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape along with the date criteria we created earlier.

## Results

Our project now has provided us the ability to gather specific data by filtering our dataset based on the criteria we provide. To perform a filtered search, all we need to do is populate any of the 5 categories we have created. You can put in multiple pieces of criteria as shown below.

Once you are satisfied with what you want to search for, just press 'Enter' on your keyboard and the table will be filtered based on your criteria. The results will look similar as below.

## Summary

One drawback of this project is the lack of the ability to clear our search criteria. Right now, in order to clear our search we must manually delete each bit of search criteria we have provided to our filter. This can be tedious if we are looking for multiple pieces of data with different criteria.

In order to further develop this project, I would recommened we add a feature to clear our search criteria. Perhaps by adding a clear button, and an event listener, we can accomplish this fairly easily.

One additional recommendation I would make for further development would involve filtering for multiple pieces of the same criteria. Perhaps I am trying to gather information on UFO sightings within multiple states or an entire region like the North East. By having the ability to search for multiple entries in the same criteria, we would be able to do this.
